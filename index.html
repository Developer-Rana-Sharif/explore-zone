        <p>Marvel was started in 1939 by Martin Goodman as Timely Comics,[3] and by 1951 had generally become known as
            Atlas
            Comics. The Marvel era began in June 1961 with the launch of The Fantastic Four and other superhero titles
            created by</p>
        Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and many others. The Marvel brand, which had been used over the years and
        decades, was
        solidified as the company's primary brand.

        Marvel counts among its characters such well-known superheroes as Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor,
        Doctor
        Strange, Hulk, Daredevil, Wolverine, Black Panther, and Captain Marvel, as well as popular superhero teams such
        as the
        Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic Four, and Guardians of the Galaxy. Its stable of well-known supervillains includes
        the likes
        of Doctor Doom, Magneto, Ultron, Thanos, Kang the Conqueror, Green Goblin, Red Skull, Galactus, Loki, and
        Kingpin. Most
        of Marvel's fictional characters operate in a single reality known as the Marvel Universe, with most locations
        mirroring
        real-life places; many major characters are based in New York City, New York, United States.[4] Additionally,
        Marvel has
        published several licensed properties from other companies. This includes Star Wars comics twice from 1977 to
        1986 and
        again since 2015.</p>

        <p>DC Comics is one of the largest and oldest American comic book companies, with their first comic under the DC
            banner
            being published in 1937.[8] The majority of its publications take place within the fictional DC Universe and
            feature</p>
        numerous culturally iconic heroic characters, such as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman, Green
        Lantern, and
        Cyborg; as well as famous fictional teams including the Justice League, the Justice Society of America, the
        Justice
        League Dark, the Doom Patrol, and the Teen Titans. The universe also features an assortment of well-known
        supervillains
        such as Lex Luthor, the Joker, the Cheetah, the Reverse-Flash, Black Manta, Sinestro, and Darkseid. The company
        has
        published non-DC Universe-related material, including Watchmen, V for Vendetta, Fables and many titles under
        their
        alternative imprint Vertigo and now DC Black Label.

        Originally in Manhattan at 432 Fourth Avenue, the DC Comics offices have been located at 480 and later 575
        Lexington
        Avenue; 909 Third Avenue; 75 Rockefeller Plaza; 666 Fifth Avenue; and 1325 Avenue of the Americas. DC had its
        headquarters at 1700 Broadway, Midtown Manhattan, New York City, but DC Entertainment relocated its headquarters
        to
        Burbank, California in April 2015.[9]</p>

        <p>Columbia Pictures&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Industries, Inc. is an American company that produces
            movies
            and at one time, television shows. It is
            now one of the "Big Five" American movie studios and the oldest, busiest and most well-known member of
            the
            Sony Pictures
            Motion Picture Group, which is owned by the Japanese company Sony. Sony Pictures also includes smaller
            studios like
            TriStar Pictures, Screen Gems, and Sony Pictures Animation. The studio buildings are located at the Sony
            Pictures
            Studios lot in Culver City, California.
            <hr>
            <b>History:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;Formed in 1918 as CBC Film Sales by brothers Jack and Harry Cohn and their
            partner Joe Brandt, the studio started out
            very small. It eventually adopted the "Columbia" name in 1924 and became better known and successful
            under
            president
            Harry Cohn and film director Frank Capra making Western movies, comedy movies, and short films.[3] After
            Harry Cohn
            died,[4] the studio went under hard times in the 1960s and 1970s before being bought by the Coca-Cola
            Company in
            1982.[5][6] It created a side project with CBS and HBO that became TriStar Pictures and started making
            more
            successful
            films again such as the Ghostbusters movies and The Karate Kid.

            Coca-Cola spun off Columbia into its own company again in 1987, which at that point had fully bought
            TriStar
            and other
            companies such as Merv Griffin's company, which was known for making Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy!.[7]
            In
            1989, Sony
            Corporation decided to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment, which included both Columbia and
            TriStar.[8][9]
            Under Sony,
            Columbia moved into the former MGM studios after years of sharing space with Warner Bros. Columbia and
            TriStar continued
            making their own movies and TV shows before combining under the Sony name in 1999.[10]<b>

                    <p>Universal Studios Florida is a theme park located in Orlando, Florida, that opened on June 7,
                        1990. Owned and
                        operated
                        by NBCUniversal, it features numerous rides, attractions, and live shows that are primarily
                        themed to
                        movies,
                        television, and other aspects of the entertainment industry. Universal Studios Florida was the
                        first of
                        three theme</p>
                    parks to open at Universal Orlando Resort, joined later by Islands of Adventure in 1999 and Volcano
                    Bay in
                    2017. In
                    2019, it ranked eleventh in the world – sixth in North America – for overall attendance among
                    amusement
                    parks with
                    approximately 10.9 million visitors.

                    The success of its sister location, Universal Studios Hollywood, in the 1980s fueled the desire to
                    build a
                    similar park
                    in the Orlando area to compete with Walt Disney World. Two of its early projects were partially
                    developed by
                    famed
                    Hollywood director Steven Spielberg, and many themed attractions over the years were developed in
                    close
                    collaboration
                    with the directors, producers, and actors of the films they are based on. An early layout and design
                    of the
                    park also
                    incorporated active production studios, similar to the Hollywood location, which provided guests a
                    behind-the-scenes
                    look at film and television. As the interest to produce films in the Orlando area quickly faded, the
                    design
                    of the park
                    transitioned to a more immersive, first-person perspective.

                    Universal Studios Florida operates a well-known annual event during the fall season called Halloween
                    Horror
                    Nights,
                    where the park transitions to a Halloween theme featuring haunted houses and scare zones on select
                    nights. One
                    of the
                    park's biggest draws is Diagon Alley, a Harry Potter-themed portion of the The Wizarding World of
                    Harry Potter
                    that
                    opened in 2014. Other notable attractions include E.T. Adventure, which debuted with the park's
                    grand opening in
                    1990,
                    Men in Black: Alien Attack, as well as roller coasters Revenge of the Mummy and Hollywood Rip Ride
                    Rockit.
